      "description" : "Records of Officer Involved Shootings (OIS) from 2005 to the present, including a brief narrative synopsis. Data set does not contain records from active investigations. Data is visualized in a dashboard on the SPD public site (https://www.seattle.gov/police/information-and-data/use-of-force-data/officer-involved-shootings-dashboard), please reference as a guide for use. Dashboard is available for download.  \n\nUntil 2017, the Seattle Police Department had been updating these data as cases completed the inquest and other external processes. Given the current delay in the those systems, SPD is now going to post updates when the Force Review Board has determined if the action(s) was within policy. \n\nUse of force data also available here: https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/Use-Of-Force/ppi5-g2bj and is updated daily. Data includes Type III - OIS.",

The subject seated on the bench got up and began to move in a ‘flanking motion’ toward the officer.   The officer then noticed that the subject was carrying a bright colored handgun in his hand.  The officer gave commands to drop the weapon, secured his K-9 partner, and advised radio of the situation.   The suspect then began to raise his weapon toward the officer.

The subject continued to advance toward the officer’s car and became more aggressive. The officer fired four rounds, striking the subject. The subject fell to the ground and dropped the knives.

The vehicle was marked with emergency lights activated to signal the stop. The stop was conducted based on an observed illegal lane change. Additionally, a check of the Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL) system, indicated the registered owner of the vehicle had a “suspended / revoked” license. The driver of the vehicle complied with the traffic stop, pulling into a parking lot. As the vehicle came to a stop, the male driver attempted to exit the vehicle. Officers instructed the subject to remain in the vehicle and he complied. On initial contact with the occupants of the vehicle (a male driver and female passenger), officers determined the driver was not the registered owner the of vehicle and was not carrying identification but provided a name and date of birth. The officers returned to their vehicle to conduct a records check and determined the information provided by the driver was false. The officers requested additional units and two additional two-officer units arrived, as backup.

At 7:33 P.M., paramedics from the Seattle Fire Department arrived on scene and began rendering aid. \nThe subject died at the scene." ]
